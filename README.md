This repository contains a static web application built to mimic the front-end of Amazon's e-commerce website.
The project is constructed using pure HTML and CSS, showcasing a range of web design techniques and responsive design principles. 
It includes various key pages such as the homepage, product listings, customer service, and a shopping cart.
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the ability to replicate complex layouts and user interfaces using only HTML and CSS, providing a solid foundation for further development with backend functionalities. Feel free to explore the code or suggest some improvements!
